# Scalable mushroom production: growing them using 'appropriate technology' methods (aimed at developing countries)
## Summary
_We use small-scale experimental investigations to determine the feasibility of mushroom cultivation using methods that reduce the reliance on electricity._

We are currently formulating our game plan. To read what we're deliberating, head over to our [discussion space](https://www.researchgate.net/post/Mushroom_cultivation_can_we_reduce_water_needed_for_entire_process_while_also_providing_drinking_water_for_billions_of_people).

>**We believe that research & development should be for all, not just the rich.**

## Progress summary
We have successfully fruited some financially high-valued mushrooms under semi-controlled environmental conditions using lower-tech methods.
